# reaper-novation-performance-sample-board
Use a novation launchpad mk3 to record and play samples while you perform


## Alternatives

This plugin targets "real time" recording and performance without use a mouse. There are other plugins that may work better if you have a limited set of samples you want to use. 

*a The built in reasamplomatic 5000 probably works well for "static use cases"
